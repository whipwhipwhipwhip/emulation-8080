Emulation of 8080 CPU and space invaders cabinet
Status:
1. All main game functionality working (Sound, 2player)
2. Emulator works entirely for Space Invaders but does not pass all 8080 tests - some issues with auxiliary carry flags
3. Missing dipswitch stuff, but I'll probably ignore as I do other things

Todo (not for some time probably):
1. High-scores/dipswitch stuff
2. Pass all CPU tests
